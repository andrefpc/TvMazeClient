## Welcome
Tv Maze Client is an app to search and get information about produced tv series.

When I created this app, I used XML to make the views and Koin for dependency injection, but I decided to recreate these views using Jetpack Compose, using Hilt for dependency injection.
However, instead of replacing the code, I created two different paths, so that the users can choose which one to evaluate.

## Setup

The app supports Light and Dark mode.
